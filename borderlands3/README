Tested in Chrome only (Version 76.0.3809.132/Windows 10)

In order to utilize this:

1. Navigate to https://borderlands.com/en-US/vip/
2. Log in/sign up
3. Navigate to https://2kgames.crowdtwist.com/ -- This is a blank page, as there is no landing page
4. Open up Chrome's console (F12)
5. Paste the contents of the script inside, and hit enter
6. Final results will be presented within a pop-up

Note: This currently utilizes a static script, so codes will have to be maintained in some fashion; at some point may look into integrating it to automatically gathering codes, perhaps a database of sorts

There may be a better way to implement this, but this is what I was able to figure out in a short period of time/low effort. Beats putting in codes manually.

TODO (no particular order):
* Database for codes
* Implement feedback of codes to database (expired, etc, to not keep attempting)
* Implement "Golden Keys", as it seems that should be feasible as well
* 100% Borderlands 3


Thanks to /r/borderlands3 for the initial codes!
