Tested in Chrome only (Version 76.0.3809.132/Windows 10)

In order to utilize this:

1. Navigate to https://borderlands.com/en-US/vip/
2. Log in/sign up
3. Navigate to https://2kgames.crowdtwist.com/ -- This is a blank page, as there is no landing page
4. Open up Chrome's console (F12)
5. Paste the contents of the script inside, and hit enter
6. Final results will be presented within a pop-up

Note: This currently utilizes a static script, so codes will have to be maintained in some fashion; at some point may look into integrating it to automatically gathering codes, perhaps a database of sorts

There may be a better way to implement this, but this is what I was able to figure out in a short period of time/low effort. Beats putting in codes manually.

TODO (no particular order):
* Database for codes
    o Work not started, but scoped
* Implement feedback of codes to database (expired, etc, to not keep attempting)
    o Work not started, but scoped
* Implement "Golden Keys", as it seems that should be feasible as well
    o This has some thoughts in the main branch, but not seen-through to completion quite yet; proved out in proof-of-concept (and repeatable for BL 1 GOTY Remaster, BL2, TPS, and BL3)
* Make usage easier (from Issue #5)
    o Preliminary work has begun; plan is to utilize the MERN stack (Mongo or Maria, undetermined; purpose is to fulfill the top 2 items)
    o Automatic redemption theoretically could be performed BUT I don't know/remember if there's a login token presented
        > If not, the only way would be to store passwords, and I don't think there's any good way to secure this as such (and I imagine people reuse emails/passwords, and the "greater good" would be to not allow this). 
    o Frontend is 99% developed, only need is to tie to backend (to be developed) and possibly update formatting (frontend is not my forte and hasn't been my focus in a long, long time)
        o Front end would need to be updated for options other than Borderlands 3 for Golden Keys, as I'm sure there are plenty of people that still enjoy BL2/BL1 GOTY Remaster/TPS (maybe?)
* 100% Borderlands 3
    o Beat main story, no side missions or level 50 yet; started as Moze, rerolled, took Zane through the story, and rerolled a Fl4k. XBL GT: rockdevourer
